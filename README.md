# Police Station Locations and Criminal Records in Seattle

## Project Description
The issue of criminal activity has been receiving a lot of attention in Seattle recently. Headlines abound about retail theft and gun violence. The incidence of criminal activity has risen. This web map interface depicts data on criminal records and law enforcement locations in the Seattle area. Specifically, our visualization includes all categories of law enforcement agencies, such as police and sheriff stations, patrol offices, etc. We also showcase the relative locations of the crime reports against person since July 2022, broken down by different categorical features, such as offense categories, precinct, etc. 

## Project Goal
To incorporate our topic of sorting by distance, we aim to achieve distance to crime from the nearest law enforcement locations. Doing so will give the audience a clear visualization of data which will help them: 
- See crime density in the area
- See law enforcement locations in the area
- See the correlation between the above 2

The main two audiences that inspire the creation of this project are
1. The general public
2. Governing powers that operate law enforcements

The general public should have easy access to know the crimes happening within their areas of interest. We feel that our interface will benefit them to see where crime is committed and if law enforcement is close enough to minimize it.
